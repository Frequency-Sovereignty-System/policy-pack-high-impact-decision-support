## [1.0.0] - 2025-12-21

### Initial Reference Release

- Initial public release of the **PP-HIGH-IMPACT-DECISION-SUPPORT** PolicyPack.
- Defined a non-binding, design-time reference boundary for identifying
  high-impact decision contexts in AI-assisted systems.
- Established interpretive signals for scenarios where additional
  human confirmation, reflection, or escalation may be appropriate.
- Clarified non-executive positioning:
  - No decision execution
  - No enforcement
  - No professional advice (legal, financial, medical, or psychological)
- Documented responsibility boundaries, confirming that all interpretation,
  implementation, enforcement, and outcomes remain implementer-owned.
